				<p class="lead">BY the mighty Brisbane River, a touch over 360 WordPress professionals and enthusiasts attended the two-day WordCamp conference across two auditoriums at the QUT Garden Point campus.

					A schedule of 27 sessions covered the business and technical side of WordPress - the world’s most popular content management system - with 30 speakers listed on the WordCamp Brisbane website (some of the talks were double-acts).

				<strong><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Jen Jeavons: Humanising your digital experience</strong>
			</h2>
			<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;At this point everything was starting to unravel. The record company was on me, telling me I need to get a tan and a boob job and get photographed down on Bondi Beach like Sophie Monk was.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>No, this wasn&rsquo;t a derailing website project for a client in the music industry with boundary issues. Rather, Jen Jeavons was recalling her pre-digital days as a pop music writer and performer.</p>
<p>Jeavons, now managing director of Pixel Palace digital agency in Brisbane, advocates putting a person out front of a business and, accordingly, was telling her story at WordCamp Brisbane 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started realising that humanising my story like this has massive value. It&rsquo;s making people connect with me, understanding it wasn&rsquo;t all great. Showing some vulnerability. They remember me.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Pop success, poor pay</h4>
<p>Long story short: It&rsquo;s the late 90s and the-then Jen Waite flees from an applied science degree (quirkily, at the university where she was speaking) and travels the world a few times as a backup singer for the chart-topping duo, Savage Garden. After which, in 2001, she has a big hit of her own, Pleased to Meet You, with her band Aneiki. In fact, it was the most-played song on Australian radio that year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She evoked a murmur from the WordCamp audience when she revealed her taxable income for that year was a mere $4000 (one person in the audience had guessed $1 million). And that was about as good as it got for Jeavons in Aussie pop music. The hits dried up and the record company cut her loose. But they let her access the website they had built for Aneiki, which they had no plans to maintain or update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To stay in touch with her fans, Jeavons had to learn how to work the website. She took a course and found her new passion, and successful career.</p>
<h4>Sharing is caring</h4>
<p>For years she shied away from discussing her pop past because she felt people would think her a failure. But that&rsquo;s changed. She&rsquo;s embraced her one-hit history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m using it now. I&rsquo;m telling this story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being real and open and genuine and showing vulnerability let's people connect with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jen and her husband, Ryadan Jeavons, also own a coffee e-shop, CoffeeBeansDelivered.com.au, launched a few years ago, in part, to show they could walk the walk as an e-commerce agency.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, in keeping with Jen&rsquo;s push to humanise the digital experience, Ryadan was shoved out the front of the coffee site. There&rsquo;s a pic of him on the home page, he&rsquo;ll send handwritten notes with some deliveries, he calls customers to put out spot fires and, crucially, appears in a series of tips&rsquo;n&rsquo;tricks videos for their social media funnel.</p>
<p>Jen said: &ldquo;What this has done for customer feedback and ownership has been honestly gobsmacking. I can't believe what it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take, for example, customer reaction to a bad courier experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tone is materially different in how they communicate with us because they feel like it's a person who they like, so I think this is super powerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you know, there's a generation coming through of digital natives that don't have a distinction between their digital world and their real world and so we have to be doing this in order to really connect with everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Live chat</h4>
<p>Jen&rsquo;s also a fan of live chat - she uses Tawk.to on the coffee site and Crisp.chat for Pixel Palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are stats that say live chat increases conversion on an e-commerce site by 30 to 40 per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can testify that. It did it for Coffee Beans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people are in a product, being able to talk to a real human and ask a question in real<br />time is hugely helpful in getting them to get right to that end bit and press &lsquo;Go&rsquo; on the payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Designing for humans is the approach Jen recommends, with focus on four areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your user</li>
<li>Design for emotion</li>
<li>Beware of sensory adaptation</li>
<li>Cut cognitive load</li>
</ul>

<h4>White noise</h4>

<p>What&rsquo;s sensory adaptation, you ask? People tend to block out a stimulus they are frequently exposed to. Say you spend a day in a strange house with a grandfather clock. It gives you a start every time it chimes on the hour. But after a week you&rsquo;ve stopped noticing the booming &ldquo;boings&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s sensory adaptation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a digital example, think of a banner ad on a website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everyone in your industry has the same exact layout, this is going to play into sensory adaptation. People start filtering out stuff because it looks the same as everything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can change this up by adding in little elements of surprise and delight into your site design-wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s colour, typography, photography, the wording, copy, headlines, not using the same headline that everybody else uses, so that you stand out and you jolt people out of that sensory adaptation problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On cognitive load, Jen said: &ldquo;If people get to a site and they&rsquo;re overwhelmed they switch off, they bail out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many fonts, too much content jammed in, not enough white space, not a clear user path, bad navigation, not knowing where to click - that just tires people, whether they realise it or not, and they start dropping off.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Show the way</h4>

<p>&lsquo;Guided selling&rsquo; as a remedy for cognitive load and/or choice paralysis had worked well on the coffee website, Jen said.</p>
<p>Visitors are offered a &ldquo;Help Me Decide&rdquo; button on the home page, which takes them through a Gravity Forms-powered quiz to produce a product recommendation for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we did this it increased our conversions by over 200 per cent immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jen described her method as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put a person out front</li>
<li>Outperform your competition</li>
<li>Create a unique experience</li>
<li>Deliver your product faster</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants to read a mission statement from Tesla but they do want to read a blog post from Elon Musk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><strong>My Two Cents Worth:</strong> Two things. Firstly, exercise some caution if you&rsquo;re tempted to change website layouts as a remedy for sensory adaptation. It&rsquo;s true there has developed a sameness to website design and structure but that&rsquo;s because the sector has matured and settled upon a format that works.</p>

			<strong><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Mandy Weidmann: Building a community using All.The.Tools</h2></strong>
<p>Procrastinators be advised - you and Mandy Weidmann will probably have little to chat about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dreamer <em>and</em> a doer. I get stuff done,&rdquo; the &lsquo;Fundraising Whisperer&rsquo; told her WordCamp Brisbane audience.<br /><br />&ldquo;I actually have this saying; I like to add GSD to everything I do, which is Get Shit Done.&rdquo; (This is a play on GST, an Australian consumption tax that is added to most goods and services.)</p>
<p>Mandy is owner and editor of the Fundraising Directory and she was putting herself forward at WordCamp Brisbane 2018 as a WordPress publisher, with particular focus on her recent website redevelopment and her love of plugins and other apps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mess around with tools all the time and try to push the boundaries of what they can do for me and my audience,&rdquo; the &lsquo;recovering lawyer&rsquo; said.</p>

<h4>Guided navigation</h4>

<p>For example, on her new website Mandy uses a chatbot, Quriobot (with MailChimp signup built-in), as a form of guided navigation to take users to the content they&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another is form-builder Typeform paired with automation tool Zapier. She&rsquo;ll send a templated form to one of her supplier-advertisers on the topic of, say, &ldquo;A Day in Your Life&rdquo;. They&rsquo;ll complete the form and, thanks to Zapier, their replies will appear in backend of her WordPress site as a Post, ready to go after any editing. In return for this coverage on her website, Mandy receives a link back from the advertiser, which supports her Google search ranking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main way Mandy creates content, however, is via her Facebook page and groups where she has close to 40,000 followers and members. Someone will ask, for instance, &ldquo;How do I run a successful P&amp;C sausage sizzle?&rdquo; and all the experienced fundraisers will reply. Mandy then compiles those replies into a fresh resource for the website.</p>
<p>Until recently, Mandy ran three websites to which databases and other functionality had been tacked on over the years. She brought in Brisbane&rsquo;s OSE digital agency to consolidate the websites into one and to optimise its performance.</p>

<h4>Disgruntled customers</h4>

<p>OSE&rsquo;s Paul Dunstone joined Mandy&rsquo;s presentation to discuss in more detail the redevelopment, which had included a complete migration to Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We actually seeing 50 per cent of new business coming through the door of disgruntled customers who&rsquo;ve had a previous developer,&rdquo; Paul said. (There was no mention of whether Mandy had been displeased with her previous agency.)</p>
<p>He said WordPress had extended well beyond &ldquo;cutsie little blogs and mum and dad sites&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some serious projects online that are in WordPress. There are some very big players who use WordPress. And the people who really succeed in WordPress are very strategic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul stressed the need for clients to devote attention and energy to their digital project, rather than assuming the &ldquo;web developer will solve all my problems and I&rsquo;ll take no involvement&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A web project really runs well when the client takes some time to invest in it. After all, it is their business.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Addicted to apps</h4>

<p>Mandy admitted to the audience she was an &ldquo;app addict&rdquo;. Paul said: &ldquo;The WordPress community has a terrible reputation of loading up websites with plugin upon plugin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much so that we are actually seeing clients come in with 75 plugins installed on their website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plugins add code complexity and many - WooCommerce for example - will load their scripts on every page of the website, whether they are used on that page or not. This harms load speeds, which equates to lost users/clients/dollars.</p>
<p>Paul said he ran audits on new clients&rsquo; websites and would rip out plugins where possible. He also used PHP code &ldquo;include&rdquo; statements to selectively deploy plugin files only where they were needed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s super simple, fundamental, and hardly anybody does it.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Mandatory maintenance</h4>

<p>He also reminded current and would-be website owners that digital projects came with ongoing maintenance and other costs beyond initial setup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like everyone has forgotten that these days.<br /><br />&ldquo;Maintenance is something that you need to be considering upfront.<br /><br />&ldquo;It may be annoying to spend an extra 20 bucks on a server to backup your site per month, but for us to recover the whole thing when you wipe over a file or completely destroy things is exponential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority of his e-commerce clients were seeing 60 per cent of access via a mobile device, he said.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p><strong>M2CW:</strong> There were some useful takeaways from Mandy&rsquo;s talk, beyond WordPress.</p>
<p>She offered these four bits of business advice for success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t listen to unsolicited advice (She was aware of the irony)</li>
<li>A business is only a clever idea until someone hands over money</li>
<li>Stay fun</li>
<li>Persistence overcomes resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting Fundraising Directory, Mandy had a flop with another business idea - laundry detergent as a fundraising product. But she kept moving forward. And then her co-founder, Helen, died. Mandy grieved, and then she kept moving forward.</p>
<p>The supplier directory is a good example of business success from solving a problem. Her words: &ldquo;School and club fundraising organisers were time-poor volunteers with a high turnover and not much handover or guidance. They were reinventing the wheel all of the time and didn't know where to look for help.&rdquo; But with the help of the Fundraising Whisperer and her content and list of suppliers, there can be less of a learning curve and more continuity, efficiency and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Mandy sat in on Jen Jeavons&rsquo; presentation but she might benefited from her advice on &ldquo;cognitive load&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s quite a lot to take in on the Fundraising Directory homepage and the entry points are slightly challenging. As we said in my in newspaper days, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;busy&rdquo;.</p>

		<strong><h2 id="wc3"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Leon Stafford: WordPress as a static site generator</h2></strong>
<p>Stafford is the author of the WP Static Site Generator plugin.</p>
<p>WordPress websites are &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; in that they interact with a database to compile their content &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Stafford says, this means they are resource intensive, available online only and need security from hackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His plugin creates a standalone, &ldquo;static&rdquo; HTML copy of the WordPress website. &ldquo;Visually there&rsquo;s no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That version is then hosted and served to the public. Staffords says it&rsquo;s low resource, usable offline and secure by default. &ldquo;With no database, no PHP, there is very little attack vector left exposed.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Save money</h4>

<p>And with no database, free or dirt-cheap hosting options such as Netlify and Amazon S3 become available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can throw crazy amounts of traffic at it and it won&rsquo;t break a sweat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without PHP though, some third-party integrations are needed to power contact forms, comments, site searches and e-commerce, he says.</p>
<p>WordPress designers/developers can use static versions of websites to archive their body of work online, or to share a version with clients via USB or disc, Stafford says.</p>

<h4>Easier way</h4>

<p>One advantage to WordPress, he says, is that other static site generators - such as Hugo - require operation from the command line, a skill most clients will be missing and reluctant to learn.</p>

		<strong><h2 id="wc4"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Andrew Duncan: WooCommerce REST API integration</h2></strong>
<p>As Zell Liew wrote over at SmashingMagazine.com: &ldquo;An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for &ldquo;Representational State Transfer&rdquo;. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WordPress has a REST API. So does WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Speaker Andrew Duncan, CEO/owner of Databuzz, says the API will integrate Woo with a business&rsquo;s other office software such as a CRM and accounting tool (Xero, MYOB etc).</p>
<p>Duncan offers these sort of integrations as a service and in his own business he hooks it up with FileMaker, for which he is a certified developer, and with Xero.</p>

<h4>Puzzle solved</h4>

<p>He told his audience he runs a couple of e-shops powered by WooCommerce, which was a big improvement over his old method - a PayPal button. &ldquo;(But) the missing piece of the puzzle for us is we didn&rsquo;t use WordPress for our business software.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s talk was quite technical and aimed more at backend developers. But all varieties of WP users will appreciate the potential of APIs, whereby all manner of previously standalone software can become essentially a WordPress or WooCommerce add-on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;APIs are eating the world,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<strong><h2 id="wc5"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;WordPress 5.0: Gutenberg editor, Twenty Nineteen, and more</h2></strong>
<p>Dion Hulse, a NSW-based lead developer at WordPress.org, led this discussion just before lunch on the first day.</p>
<p>Hulse speculated that WordPress&rsquo;s new blocks-based Gutenberg editor - which has page builder-type functionality - might mean the need for &ldquo;themes&rdquo; as we know them could disappear and the marketplace will morph into &ldquo;selling page templates rather than themes&rdquo;. You see that already actually with third-party page builders such as Elementor and Beaver Builder.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p><strong>M2CW:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting watching the rise of page builders in WordPress. Frontend developers who hand-tag designs and layouts in CSS and HTML can tend to look derisively at designers who use WYSIWYG page builders. They&rsquo;re not <strong><em>real</em></strong> developers, they reckon.</p>
<p>Much of my 20 years as a newspaperman was spent in news design. Early on, we used meta-tags within publishing software called ATEX to lay out pages. You could control elements including font, face, size, leading, kerning, margin padding, and even absolute positioning. Sound familiar? It was area markup, just like CSS and HTML, except the area was a tabloid printed page not a browser window. Later, with software advances, we started to use drop&rsquo;n&rsquo;drag editors such as QuarkExpress and InDesign. Now, all news pages are laid out this way and the idea that you would mark up a page with tags is strange. Not one person thinks production journalists who lay out pages via drop&rsquo;n&rsquo;drag software aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;real&rdquo; news designers. It makes me wonder what the future holds for CSS developers.</p></div><a href="#top"><p>>> Back to table of contents</p></a>

		<strong><h2 id="wc6"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Dale Reardon: My experience building and operating an online community and social media platform on WordPress for the disability sector</h2></strong>
<p>Dale Reardon is the founder of MyDisabilityMatters.club, a start-up social network for the Disability Community that runs on WordPress with a forum.</p>
<p>Reardon, who is blind, says they have more than 5000 users worldwide. He said 20 per cent of the world had a disability, including &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; types such as anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>He said CAPTCHA tests were a problem for screen readers, as were PDF files and Flash-based websites, which were still prevalent in Europe.</p>

<h4>JavaScript problems</h4>

<p>He also cautioned about JavaScript. &ldquo;The more JavaScript you use on your page, the more problems you have.&rdquo; (Interestingly, in late 2015, WordPress head honcho Matt Mullenweg told the WordPress Community to &ldquo;learn JavaScript, deeply&rdquo;. The new Gutenberg editor has a heavy reliance on JavaScript.)</p>
<p>MDM started with BuddyPress forum, then switched to social networking plugin PeepSo, but is now moving back to BuddyPress because &ldquo;approaching 5000 members caused serious performance and stability issues with PeepSo, despite premium hosting (Kinsta)&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reardon wasn&rsquo;t the only presenter to flag speed and reliability issues with more complicated and content-heavy WordPress sites, especially when combined with high traffic. Many calls to the database at the same time and WP seems to struggle without some backend and server optimisations. As part of his set-up, Readon utilises &ldquo;object caching&rdquo;, which he said makes his site much faster. Other speakers mentioned this as well.</p>

<h4>Accessibility</h4>

<p>Anyway, WordPress has an accessibility team, which Reardon says was one reason he chose it. (WordPress accessibility team leader Rian Rietveld quit in October due to what she said were political complications and problems working on Gutenberg accessibility. Rietveld also took a parting shot at WordPress supremo Mullenweg. &ldquo;Please take better care of your community, because WordPress is nothing without it,&rdquo; she told Mullenweg, among other things.)</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, only had three people on its accessibility team, Reardon said, which indicated it didn&rsquo;t prioritise usability for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>He also said Facebook was complicated and changed its layout frequently, which was bad for screen-reader users who get thrown when features move in-between visits.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p><strong>M2CW:</strong> I realise we live in a Minimum Viable Product world, but understand that WordPress out-of-the-box will likely struggle when your website gets big and busy and you&rsquo;ll then have to invest in some optimisations. Otherwise, at some point your site will struggle or crash and you&rsquo;ll lose users/customers, and money.</p>
<p>Website and other app accessibility seems like a huge sleeper issue. For example, the well-publicised diabetes pandemic will mean an explosion in the number of people with eyesight issues. Commercial imperatives will force companies to optimise their websites for those with vision impairment from diabetes or lose them as customers/users.</p>
<p>As we live more and more of our lives in the digital world, the disabled communities will force governments to impose accessibility standards on the web, like those that exist in the physical world (wheelchair ramps etc).</p>
<p>And as advocates say: Good accessibility is also good user experience for those without disabilities. You can&rsquo;t lose.</p></div><a href="#top"><p>>> Back to table of contents</p></a>

<strong><h2 id="wc7"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Tony Cosentino: Podcasting with WordPress</h2></strong>

<p>&ldquo;You all have great stories to tell. Each and every person here has got their own cool stories,&rdquo; postcasting and WordPress guru Tony Cosentino told his audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the next couple of years I believe that audio is going to be quite prolific because of all the audio devices that are now available.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He mentioned Google Home, Apple HomePod, Alexa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more audio content you can have happening now, in the future when audio gets even more mainstream than it is right now, you&rsquo;re already positioned to audio.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>In your head</h4>

<p>When Cosentino was asked why audio over video he called for a show of hands of who had watched video that day. Only two hands were raised. When he asked who had listened to a podcast, over half the audience shot up their hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YouTube is sort of a relationship but it&rsquo;s different from having someone in your head when you&rsquo;ve got headphones on, or driving, or in the kitchen. It&rsquo;s almost like a conversation with you. It goes deeper, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked how long a podcast episode should be he said 40 minutes seemed to be the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tend to base it on the person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a great podcast you can talk for an hour and get away with it.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Step by step</h4>

<p>Cosentino&rsquo;s presentation covered 10 steps to podcasting with WordPress, including all the hardware, software and platforms required. He&rsquo;s done a great job and written a blog post at his website that covers his talk, so I won&rsquo;t steal his thunder here. Head over to <a href="https://tonycosentino.com/tcs-009-how-to-podcast-with-wordpress/">https://tonycosentino.com/tcs-009-how-to-podcast-with-wordpress/</a> for all the advice and links.</p><a href="#top"><p>>> Back to table of contents</p></a>

<strong><h2 id="wc8"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Ben McAdam: Know your numbers, increase your profits, and stress less</h2></strong>
<p>&ldquo;Virtual CFO&rdquo; Ben McAdam was one of a few speakers to reference Tim Ferris&rsquo;s self-help bestseller, <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>, which emphasises processes and automation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a virtual chief financial officer? It&rsquo;s &ldquo;like an accountant that helps business owners to understand their financial numbers and grow their businesses and profits&rdquo;, McAdam wrote on the WordCamp Brisbane website.</p>
<p>His talk was targeted, I&rsquo;m assuming, to WordPress agencies (big and small) and businesses running e-shops via WordPress platforms such as WooCommerce.</p>
<p>McAdam said there were five key business numbers to watch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Margins</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Profit</li>
<li>Cash (flow)</li>
</ol>
<p>And five ways to increase profit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review costs</li>
<li>Raise prices</li>
<li>Increase order size (think cross-selling)</li>
<li>Sell again (existing customers are cheaper to market to)</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
</ol>
<p>On productivity, McAdam proposed this framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate</li>
<li>Automate</li>
<li>Delegate</li>
<li>Efficiently do-it-yourself</li>
</ol>

<h4>Mark up prices</h4>

<p>He said prices must be marked up to at least three times the cost to deliver (excluding overheads) or a business would struggle. As a basic example, if your e-shop buys a product for $100, sell it for $300.</p>
<p>McAdam stressed the need for business owners to pay themselves a wage for their work, and aim for a 20 per cent annual profit after expenses (including their wage).</p>
<p>He challenged attendees to take action on at least one of the five way to increase profit.</p>
<p>Like podcaster Cosentino, McAdam has published his talk at his website so I won&rsquo;t steal any more of his thunder either. Check it out at <a href="https://benmcadam.me/wcbne/">https://benmcadam.me/wcbne/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MTCW:</strong> Like I wrote, Tim Ferriss's self-help bestseller, The 4-Hour Workweek, came up a few times from different speakers.</p>
<p>Automate ... 80/20 rule ... Charge more, do less &hellip; Outsource &hellip; Etc, etc ...<br /><br />But where are all these successful work-grind rejecters? Maybe I've missed them because I'm not by a Bali beach at 11.30am on a Tuesday sipping Mai Tais while my team of poorly paid, yet highly competent, freelance workers beaver away with little supervision but much dedication?What Ferriss did brilliantly, however, was identify a pain point and promise a solution. The nearly 1.5 million dejected drones who bought his book wanted to believe in an escape from their corporate servitude. He offered them hope. A variation on, '"How to Own 10 Houses and Say Goodbye to Your Boss Forever". <br /><br />The title of Ferriss's book alone is pure genius. The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich. It hits every mark.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Workweek shows the power of a problem to solve and a killer headline.</p>

<strong><h2 id="wc9"><h2 id="wc2"><i class="far fa-square"></i>&nbsp;Phillip Johnson: How we handle 90 per cent of our annual traffic in 5 minutes</h2></strong>
<p>You know that feeling when something goes seriously badly wrong at work? Developer Phillip Johnson sure does.</p>
<p>Phillip works for the Bolster agency in Melbourne, which, to quote its website, specialises in &ldquo;digital, creative and content for the music, events and entertainment industries&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One of their big gigs is Groovin the Moo, a music festival held annually over three weekends in six regional centres across Australia. Back in January 2017 after a holiday in India, Phillip lobbed back at the office a couple of days before the main website for that year&rsquo;s festival was set to be propelled at the public.</p>
<p>As is typical for festivals such as Groovin the Moo, the promoters build excitement and anticipation over the line-up of performers and then, when it&rsquo;s time for the big reveal, a media and marketing blitz creates a stampede of traffic to the website, where can be found all the thrilling (and complex, information architecture-wise) details.</p>
<p>Before that moment, the festival is represented online by just a bare-bones static site with branding and little else.</p>
<p>Now remember, Phillip has been on vacation. &ldquo;The guy at the time decided, cool, what we'll do is the client will connect to a load balancer, that load balancer will then have multiple EC2 instances on AWS and those EC2 instances will have an RDS database and have all our uploads going to an S3 bucket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>QUICK EXPLAINER: Phillip was describing the web server setup for Groovin the Moo on Amazon Web Services - that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;AWS&rdquo; bit.</p>
<p>More decoding for the non-techies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client: The web browser (Chrome, Firefox etc) on the visitor&rsquo;s device (desktop, tablet, smartphones) that connects to the website.</li>
<li>Load balancer: Distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers.</li>
<li>EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - virtual servers in the cloud referred to as &ldquo;instances&rdquo;.</li>
<li>RDS: Amazon Relational Database Service - to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.</li>
<li>S3: Amazon cloud storage service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, keep reading and he&rsquo;ll mention &ldquo;SQL&rdquo; - that&rsquo;s a programming language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.</p>
<p>Phillip said: &ldquo;Fortunately, before any of these sites go live it's usually got a static web page, so we had just hosted that in an S3 bucket and our plan for the launch was we would have the load balancer point to the one EC2 instance that's got the static page and then we'll just switch it over, point to the multiple instances and there'll be zero downtime.<br /><br />&ldquo;At least that was the plan,&rdquo; he said, ominously.</p>
<p>At 8am on launch day, they &ldquo;flick the switch&rdquo; to the superduper important main website and ... and ... and &hellip; a weird pic of a butterfly appears where their website should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had an influx of 16,500 users between the hours of 8am and 9am. Previously there was maybe 300 users on the site. So we had gone through and built a site that couldn't handle the traffic that we've got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crickey! What went wrong?.</p>
<p>Bolster had built the project with ease-of-use for the owners as a priority, whereby the festival organisers could &ldquo;enter the content once and reuse it across the site&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To this end, a lot of custom post types and Advanced Custom Fields relationships were deployed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was actually our downfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we had created this really complex SQL setup when people went to visit the site there was far too many SQL queries and the CPU couldn&rsquo;t handle it and it crashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to be quite simple for the client and it caused a lot of problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they nutted out a solution. &ldquo;We had to spend a couple of days optimising these queries &hellip; we had to spin up larger EC2 instances so they could handle the CPU and then essentially wait until the traffic died down on the site so we could actually launch it and cache the page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phew! Festival saved.</p>
<p>Bolster remained keen on the enter-once approach, though, so Phillip &ldquo;spent pretty much the next year going through all our touring sites and our festival sites taking a look at how they were built and what we could do better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His solution - object-oriented programming and model&ndash;view&ndash;controller.</p>
<p>A little web-searching informed your intrepid writer that OOP was &ldquo;organised around objects rather than &lsquo;actions&rsquo; and data rather than logic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As for MVC, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a methodology or design pattern for successfully and efficiently relating the user interface to underlying data models&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Phillip said: &ldquo;You essentially split out the logic so you've got your styles in one section, your HTML markup in one section, you set up your models, which handles the data between the database and then you've got a controller which just says, &lsquo;Cool, get this data, put it on this page&rsquo;.&rdquo; The programmers in the audience nodded knowingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bolster also decided to change the way they deployed sites, enlisting Roots.io and its stack of open-source tools and resources for WordPress development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Roots.io website, these tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trellis - &ldquo;WordPress server running all the software you need configured according to the best practices.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Bedrock - &ldquo;WordPress boilerplate with modern development tools, easier configuration, and an improved folder structure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sage - &ldquo;WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Phillip said: &ldquo;Trellis uses Ansible playbooks to essentially allow you to provision all of your servers and deploy all the code all through the command line (rather than a user interface).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, all I need to do now when I want to go through and set up a server, I jump on to Digital Ocean (which is similar to AWS), spin up a new clean instance, make sure my SSH key&rsquo;s in there and, then, one command and it goes through, installs SQL, the right version of PHP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then if I need to go from staging to development I just change one line of code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also in the Bolster development toolkit are Timber and its template engine, Twig.</p>
<p>From the Timber website: &ldquo;With Timber you manage your theme in PHP and Twig (HTML) files. This separates the logic (getting stuff from WordPress) from presentation (adding tags, classes, etc.) &mdash; just like Rails, Django, Node and other platforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillip said about Timber: &ldquo;It's already got the concept of MVC built into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timber says on its website, &ldquo;WordPress is awesome, but the loop isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. WordPress makes extensive use of the PHP &lsquo;while loop&rsquo; command, which executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.</p>
<p>Showing the WordPress Index.php file in a Timber/Twig setup as an example, Phillip said: &ldquo;It's very similar to the original Index.php but you don't have to run through &lsquo;while loops&rsquo;, you're not trying to query the database from your theme file.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other advantage with Timber is you've got these caches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The folk at WebsiteOptimization.com have a good explanation of caching: &ldquo;Caching is the temporary storage of frequently accessed data in higher speed media &hellip; for more efficient retrieval. Web caching stores frequently used objects closer to the client through browser, proxy, or server caches. By storing &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; objects closer to your users, you avoid round trips to the origin server, reducing bandwidth consumption, server load, and most importantly, latency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillip said that Timber facilitated three forms of caching:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Partial</li>
<li>Page</li>
<li>Transient</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Now this is a good start and if I'd used any of these three caching methods within Groovin the Moo we might not have crashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he opted to kick it up a little further, with &ldquo;object caching&rdquo;, which is explained over at the WP Engine website as &ldquo;a different type of caching &ndash; instead of caching pages and resources like images, or stylesheets, it caches repeated query results. Queries are requests for data from the database on a site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillip said: &ldquo;We ended up going down the route of using an object cache and because I'd gone through and created all these classes with all my post types, I created an object cache, all those variables that I had set in in the functions were now cached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So any time an artist was called, it loaded once, it cached it, and then it served the cache<br />file for every other time that people access the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantage of that then is that you're not hitting the database, which means that all the<br />problems we had Groovin the Moo were resolved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillip tested his new processes on last year&rsquo;s Spilt Milk festival website, which, unplanned, was stuck on the smallest AWS account available.</p>
<p>In the hour from 7am on launch day the Spilt Milk site had no users. At 8am it roared up to 5500 visitors and sat between 30-40 per cent of the allowed CPU for most of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basically, throughout the entire day we had 60,000 users. I was running a full festival website on a five dollar-a-month instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>M2CW:</strong> Phillip&rsquo;s talk is the reminder that WordPress is a broad church, and there exists quite a gulf between the Divi-theme-installer-type developer who hosts customers&rsquo; sites on GoDaddy shared servers, and hard-core programmers who are verging into DevOps.&nbsp;</p>
